Take these words by the reigns,
And steer them where you will.

Remember though, remember though,
the struggle that is worthy, is the one that goes uphill.

Through blood and sweat and tears,
through toil and good hard work,
forge a life of meaning and command a path your own.

Swords are made in fire and by the beating of a hammer, and even flowers must go through mud to see the rising sun.

So steer yourself by the currents and steer you by the wind,
and ready yourself for those great waves, far, far out at sea.

For surely they will come,

For surely, they will come.

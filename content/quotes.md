*Quotes by me will have no author cited. Otherwise I will either cite the author or put "- Unknown" if I don't know who the author is.*

**"A person who never made a mistake is a person who never tried anything new."** - Albert Einstein.

**"Discipline equals freedom! GET AFTER IT!!!"** - Jocko Willink (Obviously)

**Make yourself so strong you can laugh at the things that used to break you!**

**Your BEST life or your worst. The choice is yours to make every single day!**

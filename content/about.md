Hi, I'm Adnan. 


I hate the way websites and blogs for too long have been more add than material.

I wanted to make a blog that makes you almost feel like your reading a book. I dont want to have thousands of adds all over the place so the most adds you'll see in my posts are either none, or one per post right at the very bottom after you've read the whole post.

I work in retail and then outside of work I work on me. On living and learning, progressing and getting up again every time I fall.

I write about literally anything that interests me including science, religion, self help & improvment, mental health, and as new topics take my interest moving forward you will see them represented in my posts.


## Quotes & Poems:

When I upload poetry or quotes, if you don't see a name after it that's one of mine. Otherwise I will put the authors name or, if the author is unknown then I will put - Unknown, at the end.

## Affiliate links:

I will eventually start using affiliate links at the end of articles and maybe poems. I haven't quite decided yet.


## Socials:

Feel free to follow me on Instagram, Threads and Twitter. I post at least once a day in the morning with a motivational quote or a lesson I'm learning or have just learnt from life.

Links to my socials are just below and can also be found at the bottom of every blog post I write.

If you want daily motivation through example then head on over now.

Hi, I'm Adnan. 


I hate the way websites and blogs these days are more add than material. I want to progress in life and I like writing so this will be a space for me to do just that.

I work in retail and then outside of work I work on me. On living and learning, progressing and getting up again every time I fall.

I wanted to make a blog that make you feel like your reading a book. Hopefully I've achieved that. I dont want to have thousands of adds all over the place so the most adds you'll see in my posts are either none, or one per post right at the very bottom after you've read the whole post.

I write about literally anything that interests me including science, religion, self help & improvment, mental health, and as new topics take my interest moving forward you will see them represented in my posts.

I also like writing poetry from time to time so I thought I'd add a poetry section to the site.

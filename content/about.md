Hi, I'm Adnan. 


I hate the way websites and blogs for too long have been more add than material. 
I wanted to make a blog that makes you feel like your reading a book. I dont want to have thousands of adds all over the place so the most adds you'll see in my posts are either none, or one per post right at the very bottom after you've read the whole post.

I work in retail and then outside of work I work on me. On living and learning, progressing and getting up again every time I fall.

I write about literally anything that interests me including science, religion, self help & improvment, mental health, and as new topics take my interest moving forward you will see them represented in my posts.

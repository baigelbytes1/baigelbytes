I will forge a leader of myself.

For a leader I must become.

I will craft him day by day,

and rid myself of all desires.

Of all desires but one.

To improve. To move forward.

To progress and overcome.

For those that walk the path of progress, know forward is the only way.

If itâ€™s worth it, it must be earned.

No other path or way exists.

What is written, must be done.

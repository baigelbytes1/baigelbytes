What are we without them?
<br>And with them, volcanoes,
<br>earthquakes, tsunamis
<br>and fire.

Time and again,
<br>in my heart, a desire,
<br>to be Vulcan but alas I'm human
<br>and no higher.

<br>But if I am to accept,
<br>Iâ€™m no more than a human,
<br>then it must also be true,
<br>that I am, no less.

I have no right to be complacent. I have no right to be ungrateful.

I only have the right to freedom but freedom isn't free.

Freedom is to be so grateful that every second is lived not wasted.

Freedom is to take responsibility so the ones you love can live not waste away.

Freedom is ownership through discipline not entitlement and victimhood!

Freedom is to be, your very greatest you.

Do what you can but always do your best. You have no right, to do anything less.

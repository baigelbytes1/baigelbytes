What is is that makes the rich man poor? Who crosses an ocean to open a door.

What is it that makes the poor man rich, who instead of chasing dreams stays seated playing fiddlesticks?

To want less is to have more but only in the mind.

Truly to have more is to have more to give. To have more to help with. Too many subtle hints. Stay sleeping, do not win.

No. I must win,

I - MUST!!!

And day by day I win the morning.

And day by day I win the night.

A thousand steps to the starting line, but fear not I

But fear not I.

For one day soon, one day surelyâ€¦

I WILL - HAVE WON - MY LIFE!

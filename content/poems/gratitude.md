No right have I to not be grateful, to not sing the songs of praise.

No right have I, to wonder yonder, and cry why me not they.

How pitiful, how truly sad,

to think of what I do not have,

while other have so little!

Be grateful you have eyes to see and lungs that breathe, be grateful you can walk and talk.

Be grateful you can see the sunrise or that you spent last night at home.

To sing His praises, surely that, is the highest deed of all.

To show you're grateful be truly mindful and put in all the work you can.

Be grateful for the little things and God will give you bigger things,
be grateful for the bigger things and God will give you more.

But always know what's yours is given, and by you never truly owned.

For all that is, returns to Him, who maketh all things great, and small.

It started as a trickle, a little tiny drop.

With forward moving steps I take.

I start to cause a ripple.

Through time, and space, and dream.

My past I leave within my wake, for my future, I must now make.

Pray I for my life at it's greatest. Pray I through toil and hustle.

For He who maketh all great things demands,

your words and actions be coupled.

Nothing shall He give you yet, except what you have worked for.

So hustle and toil by the sweat of your brow, then hustle and toil some more.

Learn this fast or learn this slow. The choice is yours to make.

The things of worth. The things you want,

Are **earned**,

not given away.

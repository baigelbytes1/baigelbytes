Aristotle - Wisdom from the ages (Part1).

## First, an introduction to the series. Wisdom from the ages:

> “Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” - Winston Churchill.

This is true, not just for societies and cultures at large, across centuries and millennia, but across decades, years, months and days in and throughout our own individual lives.

If you fail to learn from the mistakes of your past, you will keep repeating them and they will, time and time again, halt your progress forward, upwards, to becoming a better version of yourself.

The great thing about the ancient times is, how similar they were to our times. Sure, they may not have had the internet, computers, television or even electricity, but the human mind hasn’t changed so much in the last few thousand years.

Societies and individuals today still struggle with frighteningly similar problems to the ones faced by people thousands of years in the past and across multiple civilisations around the world.

In this series, I will attempt to uncover the people, traditions, philosophies and ultimately solutions to the key problems people face today that the philosophers, sages, warriors, kings and pheasants figured out in the eon’s that have gone by.

As you read through the articles I will post in this series you might, like me, be surprised at just how similar the lives of these ancient seekers of wisdom were to ours and how much more extreme their situations sometimes were.

Captivate your imagination and awe as you take this journey with me, exploring the wisdom of the ages.

> **”Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny.”** - Aristotle 


Don’t you want to be happy? Fitter? Stronger, smarter, better able to look after yourself and those you love. It’s not going to just happen to you. You have to be the one who makes it happen. Only you.

This is something that Aristotle realised well over 2000 years ago in a completely different civilisation to ours. Aristotle was a philosopher born in the ancient greek city of [Stagira}(https://maps.app.goo.gl/3bivXGS9GqmrRy6B6)

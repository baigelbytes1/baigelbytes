## First, an introduction to the series. Wisdom from the ages:

> “Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” - Winston Churchill.

This is true, not just for societies and cultures at large, across centuries and millennia, but across decades, years, months and days in and throughout our own individual lives.

If you fail to learn from the mistakes of your past, you will keep repeating them and they will, time and time again, halt your progress forward, upwards, to becoming a better version of yourself.

The great thing about the ancient times is, how similar they were to our times. Sure, they may not have had the internet, computers, television or even electricity, but the human mind hasn’t changed so much in the last few thousand years.

Societies and individuals today still struggle with frighteningly similar problems to the ones faced by people thousands of years in the past and across multiple civilisations around the world.

In this series, I will attempt to uncover the people, traditions, philosophies and ultimately solutions to the key problems people face today that the philosophers, sages, warriors, kings and pheasants figured out in the eon’s that have gone by.

As you read through the articles I will post in this series you might, like me, be surprised at just how similar the lives of these ancient seekers of wisdom were to ours and how much more extreme their situations sometimes were.

Captivate your imagination and awe as you take this journey with me, exploring the wisdom of the ages.

## Aristotle - “Happiness depends upon ourselves.”

> **”Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives - choice, not chance, determines your destiny.”** - Aristotle 

Don’t you want to be happy? Fitter? Stronger, smarter, better able to look after yourself and those you love. It’s not going to just happen to you. You have to be the one who makes it happen. Only you.

This is something that Aristotle realised well over 2000 years ago in a completely different civilisation to ours. Aristotle was a philosopher born in the ancient greek city of Stagira (Google Maps)[https://maps.app.goo.gl/3bivXGS9GqmrRy6B6]. But back then, Philosophers were much more than what we might call a philosopher today. Philosophy today is mostly a singular profession, more thought about and taught in universities than practiced by the people in everyday life. Philosophers in ancient times practiced what they preached, for better or for worse.

Aristotle also did not only apply his thoughts to the subject of philosophy alone. Studying, practicing, writing about and teaching natural sciences, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, the creative arts as well as philosophy, he really was a Jack of all trades and perhaps even a master. 

In 335BC Aristotle founded the Peripatetic School, a school of philosophy in the lyceum which played an influential role in the eventual development of modern science. He's also the man who tutored Alexander the great. Aristotle might just have been the greatest philosopher in history. He was certainly one of if not the most influential in his time.

So what can we learn from him that is applicable to us? The fact that life either passes us by, or is forged by our own daily repeated habitual actions. **"Excellence, is never an accident..."** remember? It's achieved through hard work, repeated daily until they become habits. Aristotle taught one of the most important lessons anyone can learn... It's all on you.

That's not the same as saying it's all about you so please don't confuse the two. What I mean to say is that its all up to you. If you want to change your life, you have to change yourself.

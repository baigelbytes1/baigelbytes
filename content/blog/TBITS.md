One day some years ago I asked myself, what would the enlightened version of me look like? I imagined another version of me in a Buddhist monks robes, sitting down meditating in front of a white picket fence with a tornado raging around me.

Despite that tornado being there and being very capable of killing me, this Enlightened version of me just sat there calm as anything, meditating.

Now I have already mentioned this Buddha in the storm in [this](https://baigelbytes.netlify.app/blog/mh2/) post but this superpower is just to great not to share again.

You see, I actually forgot he was still there. After all these years, and all the storms, he's still there, meditating, still, calm, enlightened.

I've been trying to improve my self again lately and I feel like this is the first time it's actually working because for the first time I'm focusing on the processes and not the end goals.

This blog is one of those processes and another is sleep hygeine, or getting up and going to bed at the same time every day. Everyday I'm making sure I'm in bed by 10PM and getting up at 4AM. Today was THE day that I just wanted to go back into bed and sleep for as long as possible.

I have a day job so 'as long as possble' would have meant getting up at 7am which would have been a 3 hour lye in. Let me tell you, I **REALLY** wanted to just get back into bed and go to sleep. But with Gods help I was able to stay out of bed and start my day.

A mini workout and then a shower. The water was hot, which at 4:30am isn't what usually happens. I got happy but then I remembered I was trying to get into the habit of taking cold showers, so, VERY reluctantly, I turned the dial around.

I carried on with the shower washing my hair and beard and trying to remember Wim Hoffs breathing methods but probably looking more like a woman in labour and then I remembered, I was supposed to start meditating again.

I was actually trying to avoid meditation recently because historically when I get spiritual is when I tend to lose my focus and eventually my sanity. But at the same time lately my ability to deal with stress has been getting lower and lower.

## Remembering the Buddha

It was at this moment, just as I was trying to meditate under the stream of what felt like ice cold water (definitely was in the lower single digits centigrade), that I remembered The Buddha in the storm.

I was delighted! Now I finally have a method that will allow me to learn to relax under the tap in the cold. I simply focus on the Buddha in the storm and channel his energy realising at least temporarily, that he, is me.

There I stood, for what must have been just a few minutes, meditating under the cold water at 4:30am. The water still felt cold and I still breathed like a woman in labour from time to time but the more I focused on the Buddha the more I was able to relax. I calmed my breathing right down and actually focused on the sensations of the ice cold water on my body without (in any large way) reacting to it.

This was too good to be true, but it was happening anyway. I was actually controling my mind for the first time in ages!

Once I got out of the shower and was drying myself off in my room I made a decision. No food, no coffee, nothing but water for the day. There have been many times where I've told myself I'm not going to spend money today, or I'm not going to eat outside of my meal times and I've kep failing but this is all because of me not controlling my mind.

I don't *need* to eat today. I'm not going to die from skipping food for one day. People have water fasted for weeks before and not only survived but benefitted from it, so lets see how the day goes. Will I suceed this time?


I'll update this article tonight with what happens.

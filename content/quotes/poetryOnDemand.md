I usually have to feel something to write a little poem thing.
But i thought id try and have a go, at writing poetry without being inspired..


I'm a little bit tired but ill... ill :/
Well this is no good, I've ran out of words, should i sit down and scribble or eat lemon curd?


Oh wait! Im in the office, time to get back to work!
